### **Multi-Agent Architecture for Research Report Preparation with GUI using CustomTkinter and AI Agents by crewai**  

#### **Overview**  
This project implements a **multi-agent system** for automated **research report preparation**, integrating a **graphical user interface (GUI)** built with **CustomTkinter** and **AI-powered agents** managed by **crewai**. The system enables efficient information gathering, analysis, summarization, and report generation, **exporting reports exclusively in Markdown format**.

---

### **Architecture Design**  

#### **1. User Interface Layer (CustomTkinter GUI)**  
- A **modern, interactive GUI** designed using **CustomTkinter**.  
- Allows users to input research topics and initiate the report generation process.  
- Provides **real-time progress tracking** and a **preview** of the Markdown report before export.  

#### **2. Multi-Agent System (CrewAI)**  
A network of AI agents, each with a specialized role in research and report generation:  

- **Research Agent**: Retrieves relevant information from online sources, databases, or PDFs.  
- **Analysis Agent**: Filters, structures, and refines research data.   
- **Report Generation Agent**: Formats and compiles the final Markdown report.  

All agents work asynchronously to ensure **efficiency, accuracy, and structured content generation**.

#### **3. AI-Powered Processing & NLP Integration**  
- Uses **LLMs and NLP models** for intelligent content analysis and summarization.   
- Ensures **coherent structuring** of Markdown content for readability.

#### **4. Markdown Export & Storage**  
- The final research report is **automatically generated in Markdown format**.  
- Users can **preview the Markdown file** in the GUI before saving.  
- Markdown files can be stored locally or integrated with **knowledge management systems like Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub repositories**.

### **Workflow**  

1. **User Inputs Research Topic** â†’ Through the GUI.  
2. **Research Agent Gathers Data** â†’ Fetches and validates relevant research sources.  
3. **Analysis & Summarization Agents Process Information** â†’ Extracts insights, filters redundant data, and structures content.  
4. **Report Generation Agent Finalizes Markdown Report** â†’ Formats sections, headings, and citations.  
5. **User Reviews & Saves Markdown Report** â†’ Provides a live preview before exporting the final Markdown file.
